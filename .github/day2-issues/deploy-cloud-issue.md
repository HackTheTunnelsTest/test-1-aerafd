title: Deploy to the cloud

**This is an advanced task and is only recommended for attendees with cloud experience.**

As CubeFlyer grows with web APIs to manage configuration and scores, and who knows what extra features, the game will need to deployed and managed in the cloud. This goes beyond using GitHub pages to host the site and a local configuration service.

As a **cloud engineering** team, you have been tasked with:

* Using a static hosting service to host the game site
* Providing a hosted web API for configuration hosted in the cloud
* Automating the deployment of both services when code is merged

What platform you use is up to you. Ideally you want to use a free service, and ensure you delete it after you have finished. It can take time to sign up for cloud services, and potentially need a credit card, so this task should only be undertaken by more advanced teams.

> Do **not** share cloud credentials or access with teammates unless you know what you are doing t control access. You don't want a teammate to accidentally spin up extra services that cost you money.
