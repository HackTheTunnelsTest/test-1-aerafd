One challenging part of managing open source projects is governance and management. Most developers want to write code, not manage a project, which is where project, product and program management comes in.

The CubeFlyer project has been run without much governance so far, so is in need of being managed.

As a **project management** team, you have been tasked with:

* Organizing all the open issues into projects
* Adding appropriate labelling
* Defining the workflow for contributing to the project
* Adding a CLA that must be agreed to before contributing
* Adding issue templates
* Adding relevant protections to ensure compliance to the contribution rules

> For some of these tasks, members of your team may need admin rights on the repository. The project owner should be able to enforce this
